Brief Description: 

My main ideas of the implementation is to understand what the perceptron is and how the linear regression works between one or more two classes on the graph representation. Using matplotlib and numpy libraries, we have to predict and train the data to make sure between -1 and +1 classes are accurate for every updating the parameter.
