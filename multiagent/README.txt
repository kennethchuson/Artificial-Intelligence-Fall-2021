Main ideas of implementation: 
First, I know that the reflex agent has to do with manhattan distance because I realized that the pacman does not know the far distance and detecting the ghost and the food. So using manhattan distance to compute and detecting the entities inside of a maze. Then, we need to find the minumum manhattan distance, so the pacman can directly search the long distance eating the pallets (food) and the ghost. 
Also, I have to understand the minimax algorithm is doing. It is just basically making the game decisions of between two entities that one of them is a max and min. So, I have to implement the same way for the pacman agent using the minimax implementation algorithm. 
Then the expectimax, is the same algorithm of minimax, but we need to computer the probability score. The better evaluation will take the multiply the probability score for the food, distance itself, and the capsules.
