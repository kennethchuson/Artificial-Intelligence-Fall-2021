brief description: 


My main idea of my implementation is, I have to understand the questions of what I need to do. Not only that, I also look up the important files of a pacman game and understanding how these game set ups in code. Then, I started to work on search.py that I have to implement with different graph search algorithms in each functions and the challenging part is in the searchAgents.py which that deals with finding all possible corners of food of a pacman and dealing with heuristics.
